    "text": "In 2020, I attended the World Economic Forum in Davos and the Enterprise Applications of the R Language (EARL) conference; at both events, I spoke about the planetary emergency and how using data to predict biodiversity loss can help guide us into more sustainable future. Both events generated interest and inquiries from the commercial and non-profit sectors. Over a number of international events since then, the commercial need for robust, scientific data on biodiversity impacts—along with the ability to project change into the future—has only become more obvious.\nIn response to this need, the Natural History Museum has supported the Biodiversity Futures Lab (of which I am Co-Lead) to further pursue commercial opportunities. The main aim is impact; we want to help companies make more sustainable choices. Any funds raised go back into the NHM.\nI have developed a Reproducible Analytical Pipeline in R to produce robust data on biodiversity indicators, particularly the Biodiversity Intactness Index. This pipeline allows us to respond more quickly to data requests, while ensuring reproducibility. I also lead on the improvements in statistical methodology and data enhancements.\nWe have also been engaging with the Task Force for Nature Related Financial Disclosure and others."

    "text": "I’ve been interested in the science-policy interface for a number of years, but particularly since undertaking a BBSRC-funded Fellowship at the Parliamentary Office for Science and Technology in 2014. I have continued my work in this area and highlight only a few key activities:\n\nI am a Lead Author on the Thematic assessment of the interlinkages among biodiversity, water, food and health for the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services.\nIn preparation for COP15 (2022), I developed a scenario-builder tool; this allowed me to quickly predict the Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII) under new scenarios in order to reflect daily progress of the negotiations. I worked closely with artist Thijs Biersteker, who then fed these new BII values (updated twice daily) into his artwork: a robotic plant that grew or wilted depending on our progress. Thijs and I were invited to the official COP press conference to talk about this work further.\nI was one of two science experts at the Launch of the CSaP Policy Fellows Climate and Sustainability Cluster (July 2023).\nI developed a pilot data portal for policy makers to access our biodiversity indicator data. In the run-up to COP26 (2021), this idea was developed into The Biodiversity Trends Explorer (BTE).\nI led the analysis of the BII for a piece of consultancy work for Vivid Economics, which fed into the Dasgupta Review on the Economics of Biodiversity HM Treasury (2021)."

    "text": "My full publication list can be found on my Google Scholar or ORCID page.\nOver the past few years, my scientific research has mostly focused on improving the statistical methodology behind the Biodiversity Intactness Index: a powerful indicator of the health of nature, that can assess the current state of biodiversity as well as project into the future under different scenarios.\nMy current area of interest is using our high-resolution biodiversity indicators to assess inequality in access to high-quality green space. I’m exploring this in the UK context in detail, and am working on a less detailed, global person-centered indicator of biodiversity health.\nI’m also working on The National Education Nature Park project, funded by the Department for Education. I’m leading a work package to investigate how different local conservation interventions impact biodiversity, using this data to help schools, teachers and students to decide on which intervention to put into place. I also plan to explore how we can use biodiversity data gathered by the students to develop new online tools for delivering other aspects of the curriculum (e.g. biology, maths, computer science, geography). Not all people are willing or able to do ‘hands-on’ conservation work; but through data we can find another way to engage students with the natural world."

This was a high profile event as part of The Climate Book launch. As well as engaging with students on the day, the event was also packaged into a set of learning material for students and was later released on YouTube where I was available to answer questions.\nAfter the release of the Dasgupta Review, to which my work contributed, I took part in an online panel discussion and Q&A for the Our Broken Planet Series.\nI’ve worked many times with the International Partnerships team and Our Broken Planet at the NHM to engage with young activists, including panel discussions (at the NHM and COP26), Generation Hope and the Climate Cafe, including a podcast interview.\nAt COP26 in 2021 I participated in a number of panel discussions both at the Nature Bar and the New York Times Climate Hub.\nAt COP15 in 2022, I took part in a public-facing panel discussion (Bringing Data to Life in the Biodiversity Crisis: a Discussion Between Artists and Scientists) at The Biosphere/La Biosphère (Montreal museum dedicated to the environment).\nIn 2020, I was accepted for a talk at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Protecting Biodiversity with Predictive Technology, where I presented my work allowing for annual, high resolution estimates of the health of biodiversity on land and how such data could be used to help companies make more sustainable choices (De Palma et al, 2021).\nIn 2019, I was named one of the World Economic Forum’s Young Scientists of the Year and was invited to talk about the planetary emergency in a Global Situation Space Scene Setter at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting of the New Champions, Dalian.\nI have been interviewed by the press many times (written, radio and TV, including including Sky News, BBC World News, ITV News)."
